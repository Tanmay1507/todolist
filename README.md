## 📖 User Guide

### 1. Adding a Task
* **Method:** Click on the input field labeled "Add a new task..." or "What needs to be done?".
* **Action:** Type your task and press the **Enter** key or click the **Add** (+) button.
* **Tip:** Keep tasks concise (e.g., "Buy groceries" instead of a long paragraph).

### 2. Managing Tasks
* **Mark as Done:** Click the checkbox or the circle icon to the left of the task text. This will visually strike through the text and move it toward the "Completed" status.
* **Editing:** (If supported) Double-click the task text to rename an existing entry.
* **Deleting:** Click the **Trash** icon or the **X** button on the right side of the task row to remove it permanently.

### 3. Filtering and Organization
* **All:** View every task in your list.
* **Active:** View only the items you haven't finished yet.
* **Completed:** View your accomplishments.
* **Clear Completed:** Use the "Clear Completed" button (if available) to bulk-delete finished tasks and declutter your view.

### 4. Data Persistence
* **Auto-Save:** You don't need to click "Save." The app automatically saves your list to your browser's local storage.
* **Note:** If you clear your browser's cache or private browsing data, your list will be reset.
